As the internet retail sector has been expanding at an astounding rate in the modern world, a small business wishes to create a website that is smartly and tastefully built. They have decided to utilise Azure Cloud Platform to develop an entire website. To better serve your consumers, create a website with fantastic features like a banner text slider, eye-catching hover effects, easy scrolling navigation, gallery light box effect, and more.

Project Description :

Using Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap framework, I built the web store "Elevated Fashion". It helps consumers in selecting and investigating trendy attire in accordance with their daily fashion requirements. Amazing features on this cleverly and tastefully built website include a slider for the banner text, captivating hover effects, easy scrolling navigation, gallery light box effects, and many more. This website is a 100% cross-browser responsive template that works with all devices and fits all screen sizes. Due to its appealing design, which attracts customers' attention and enables the seller to highlight their best products, this project is intended for both sellers and buyers. By doing this, a consumer can receive any thing at their door without ever leaving the house. I am using Microsoft Azure with Github to deploy the website and finish this project.
